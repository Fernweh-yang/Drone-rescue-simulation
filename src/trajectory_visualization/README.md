You are suppose to see [model](https://gitlab.lrz.de/ge23ged/autonomous-systems-2021-group-terminus/-/raw/main/project/src/trajectory_visualization/pic/rviz_screenshot_2022_03_24-02_49_51.png) like this.

During the run, you can also see the generated future trajectory, which, of course, is not always accurate, as our drones would update the next target point based on the signal strength.
